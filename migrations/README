This directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic.

## Commands

### Create a new migration

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of the changes"
```

This will automatically detect changes in your models and generate a migration script.

```

This will apply all pending migrations to bring your database to the latest version.

### Downgrade database

alembic downgrade -1
```

This will downgrade your database by one revision.

To downgrade to a specific revision:

```bash
alembic downgrade <revision_id>
```

### Get current revision

```

This will show the current revision of your database.

### Show migration history

This will show the history of migrations.

## Notes

- Test migrations in a development environment before applying to production
- Backup your database before applying migrations in production
